# GazeTracing

This application is a re-implementation of the `Gaze Tracing` functionality
in the [Windows Community Toolkit Sample App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-community-toolkit-sample-app/9nblggh4tlcq). 
Specifically, this sample provides a canvas that will show the last 100 gaze points
as a series of dots. This is very useful for validating baseline eye gaze functionality.
