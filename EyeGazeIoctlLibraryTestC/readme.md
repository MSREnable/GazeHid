# EyeGazeIoctlLibraryTestC

This sample uses the [EyeGazeIoctlLibrary DLL](../EyeGazeIoctlLibrary/readme.md) to control the
[EyeGazeIoctl Driver](/Documentation/EyeGazeIoctl.md). This sample is implemented 
in C++ and can either produce a test pattern or allow the use of the mouse to send gaze 
data.

Note: Be sure to run this sample as administrator.
