# swdevice

This application is part of the [VHIDMINI2](../Documentation/swdevice_vhidmini.md) 
example driver. The application manages the lifetime of a software device driver
created via [SwDeviceCreate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/swdevice/nf-swdevice-swdevicecreate).
The software device created uses a hardware device ID of `EYETRACKER_HID`. Once the driver has been 
created you can install an appropriate driver.
